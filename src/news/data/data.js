        Coinbase jumped into the No. 2 spot for downloads in the App Store since
        airing its historic Super Bowl ad on Sunday. <br /> <br />
        If its app store ranking on Monday is any indication, Coinbase’s
        historic Super Bowl ad Sunday evening was a big success. Coinbase has
        shot up from 186th place to second for downloads in the App Store since
        last night, second only to Peacock among iPhone users. Among finance
        apps, Coinbase is No. 1. Coinbase’s Super Bowl commercial featured a
        blank screen with a floating QR code that allowed new users to claim $15
        worth of Bitcoin and existing users to sign up for a $3 million Bitcoin
        giveaway. While there were reports of Coinbase crashing for some users,
        the QR code’s landing page got a whopping 20 million hits within just
        one minute of the ad airing, a spokesperson for the company told us.
        Coinbase is offering the new user incentive through Tuesday, Feb. 15, so
        you still have time to claim some free crypto if you didn’t already.
        That’s a lot of new crypto investors. “These ads were a clear call to
        action and global notice that crypto is here and ready for the masses.
        In that regard, they were undoubtedly successful,” says John Wu,
        president of Ava Labs, the startup behind the blockchain Avalanche. If
        you became a new Bitcoin investor after the Super Bowl, here are a few
        things to keep in mind.
