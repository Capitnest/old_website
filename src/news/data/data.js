        <Header>Crypto Donations Soar After Russia Invaded Ukraine</Header>
        <br />
        One of the largest non-governmental organizations (NGOs) providing
        support to Ukraine’s military, Come Back Alive, has received over $5
        million in bitcoin donations after Russia launched a large-scale
        offensive against Ukraine.
        <br /> <br />
        Founded in 2014, the Kyiv-based group provides support to Ukrainian
        soldiers, including a range of military equipment, training services,
        and medical supplies.
        <br /> <br />
        Donations to the BTC address listed on the organization’s website soared
        Thursday after Russia launched a full-scale military attack on Ukraine.
        At the time of writing, the wallet address has received 131.78144015
        BTC.
        <br /> <br />
        An analysis of all the donations to the address shows that 2,207
        donations totaling 126.04304091 BTC were received from Feb. 24 to late
        Feb. 25. At the current bitcoin price of $39,676.51 based on data from
        Bitcoin.com Markets, the donations received since Feb. 24 are worth more
        than $5 million.
        <br /> <br />
        In comparison, the wallet only received 1.60976481 BTC (76 donations) on
        Feb. 23, and 0.42272864 BTC (25 donations) on Feb. 22.
        <br /> <br />
        The chief scientist and co-founder of blockchain analytics platform
        Elliptic, Tom Robinson, tweeted Thursday:
        <br /> <br />
        <Quote>
          "Cryptocurrency donations in support of the Ukrainian armed forces are
          soaring."
        </Quote>
        <br /> <br />
        “Cryptocurrency is increasingly being used to crowdfund war, with the
        tacit approval of governments,” he was quoted by CNBC as saying.
        <br /> <br />
        Elliptic also did an analysis on the donations received by Come Back
        Alive. The firm described that on Feb. 24, the NGO received over
        $675,000 in bitcoin, and by 9:30 a.m. on Feb. 25, it had already
        received more than $3.4 million. Noting that over $3 million (80 BTC)
        was sent by a single donor, the firm wrote: “This pushes the total the
        group has raised in just 24 hours to over $4 million.”
        <br /> <br />
        The Come Back Alive organization began accepting bitcoin donations in
        2018. BTC donations have been surging recently, with nearly $200K
        received in the second half of 2021, according to Elliptic. Earlier this
        month, the platform published a report showing that donations in digital
        assets to Ukrainian NGOs and volunteer groups rose 900% last year.

        <Header>Patreon Removes Come Back Alive’s Fundraising Page</Header>
        <br />
        Meanwhile, Come Back Alive’s fundraising page on Patreon has been
        removed by the platform.
        <br /> <br />
        Come Back Alive Director Taras Chmut told CNBC in an interview that the
        group was receiving small amounts for several months from its page on
        Patreon, and then over $300,000 rolled in after Russia started invading
        Ukraine.
        <br /> <br />
        However, when he tried to transfer the money out to pay for equipment,
        he discovered that his organization’s page on Patreon had been removed.
        He contacted the platform which said it was looking into the case.
        <br /> <br />A Patreon spokesperson told CNBC:
        <br /> <br />
        <Quote>
          "Patreon does not allow any campaigns involved in violence or
          purchasing of military equipment, regardless of their cause."
        </Quote>
        <br />
        Chmut opined, “We have people dying because they don’t have body armor,”
        adding that Ukraine is not a rich country, and Come Back Alive has
        helped soldiers receive the equipment they need.

      "Adult film star Lana Rhoades is being criticized for her non-fungible token (NFT) project called “Cryptosis,” after $1.5 million of ethereum from the mint was withdrawn from the project’s wallet. The crypto withdrawal took place after Rhoades told her fans that the NFTs would be a “lucrative investment for holders,” and following the community disapproval, the porn star deleted her official Twitter account.",

          Lana Rhoades Is Being Accused of Rug Pulling Her NFT Project, Porn
          Star Deletes Twitter Account
        </Header>
        <br />
        Lana Rhoades is being condemned by people in the crypto industry for her
        role in an NFT project called Cryptosis, which features 6,069 NFT
        cartoon images of the adult film star. Rhoades is accused of withdrawing
        a large sum of ethereum (ETH) from the project, according to a video
        published by Coffeezilla.
        <br /> <br />
        The claim is that Rhoades touted her NFT collection as a “lucrative
        investment,” but after the withdrawal and myriad statements stemming
        from the project’s Discord channel, belief in the Cryptosis NFT project
        has plummeted.
        <br /> <br />
        Coffeezilla and others have called the move a “rug pull,” which is a
        term widely used in the crypto industry to describe a project that
        raises a large sum of value, but then the creator abandons the project
        and takes the initial funds raised as well.
        <br /> <br />
        In another{" "}
        <a href="https://youtu.be/NbvGmDJ_2Js" target="_blank">
          video
        </a>
        , the Youtuber Coffeezilla’s video description says that “Rhoades is not
        new to crypto, she has done several tokens in the past, [as] Lana has
        even helped with other NFT project rug pulls such as Stickdix, Titscoin,
        and Pawgcoin.”
        <br /> <br />
        Rhoades is apparently upset about the accusations, and she published a
        few tweets about the Youtuber after the video had been published.
        “Youtubers are f***ing sickos, diseases of the internet who will do
        anything and say anything for views,” the adult film star said. Rhoades
        added:
        <br /> <br />
        <Quote>
          "I have a 1-month-old baby to take care of, just what I wanted to do
          was scam ppl, get the f*** out of here with this bullsh**. Just bc a
          project does not go as planned does not mean there was any ill intent
          behind it. Ppl are sick trying to cause trouble for views."
        </Quote>
        <br />
        At the time of writing, the porn star’s official Twitter account is
        gone, as it’s been deleted. However, a large portion of Rhoades’ social
        media account on Twitter has been saved on{" "}
        <a href="https://www.archive.org" target="_blank">
          {" "}
          archive.org{" "}
        </a>
        .
        <br /> <br />
        Currently, people are still buying Cryptosis NFTs and on Opensea,
        Rhoades’ NFT collection has a floor price of 0.018 ether or $50.23. One
        specific listing is attempting to get $3.1 million for the Cryptosis NFT
        #5795.
        <br /> <br />
        There are many others seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars for the
        Rhoades NFTs. Although, these hopeful Cryptosis NFT sellers don’t seem
        to be selling at all. Cryptosis sales activity has plummeted since
        February 22, when the average sales price was 0.1624 ether or $453.20
        per Cryptosis NFT.

        Coinbase jumped into the No. 2 spot for downloads in the App Store since
        airing its historic Super Bowl ad on Sunday. <br /> <br />
        If its app store ranking on Monday is any indication, Coinbase’s
        historic Super Bowl ad Sunday evening was a big success. Coinbase has
        shot up from 186th place to second for downloads in the App Store since
        last night, second only to Peacock among iPhone users. Among finance
        apps, Coinbase is No. 1. Coinbase’s Super Bowl commercial featured a
        blank screen with a floating QR code that allowed new users to claim $15
        worth of Bitcoin and existing users to sign up for a $3 million Bitcoin
        giveaway. While there were reports of Coinbase crashing for some users,
        the QR code’s landing page got a whopping 20 million hits within just
        one minute of the ad airing, a spokesperson for the company told us.
        Coinbase is offering the new user incentive through Tuesday, Feb. 15, so
        you still have time to claim some free crypto if you didn’t already.
        That’s a lot of new crypto investors. “These ads were a clear call to
        action and global notice that crypto is here and ready for the masses.
        In that regard, they were undoubtedly successful,” says John Wu,
        president of Ava Labs, the startup behind the blockchain Avalanche. If
        you became a new Bitcoin investor after the Super Bowl, here are a few
        things to keep in mind.
