        Polygon/Solana look like the best contenders for games and NFTs for the
        masses. Thus I invest in poly/solana.

        some of you guys weren't here in 2017 so I have difficult news for
        you... $SOL is never hitting an ATH again. If your L1 makes $50k/day in
        fees but spends $5m/day in printing issuance - it's not sustainable. EOS
        and NEO had hype too and were also eth killers...SOL is the same
