        Someone transferred $329,220,000 in #Bitcoin and paid a fee of $0.12
        <br />
        <br />
        Thatâ€™s a transaction fee of 0.0000000003644%
        <br /> <br />
        No government bank or third party had to verify the transaction, nor
        could they have STOPPED IT, if they wanted to.
