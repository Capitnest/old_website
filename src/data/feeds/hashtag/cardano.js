        #Cardano is trending again! If you're new to the community, one thing
        about the $ADA community that is unique is that we're all willing to
        educate.
        <br /> <br />
        If you have any questions about staking, #CNFTs, blockchain, voting,
        reach out. I will help you personally. May take some time. üòä

        It's unbelievable that journalists think the Cardano community will
        abandon the project because of the price. The success of the #Cardano
        project is not measured by the price of $ADA coins. Cardano is a
        mission-oriented project and the goal is to disrupt the financial world.

        I just paid using my Mastercard, the artist received USDC on Polygon and
        I got a Cardano NFT.

        Not gonna lie, that was pretty smooth. The first step towards a seemless
